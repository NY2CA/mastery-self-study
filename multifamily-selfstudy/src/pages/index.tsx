/*
 * Multifamily Mastery — Landing page.
 *
 * This page is a faithful port of the original standalone marketing HTML
 * (rescia-multifamily-mastery landing page.html) into a Next.js Pages-router
 * component. Content, structure, copy, Diva Rescia + Lou Lopez bios, FAQ,
 * modal funnel — all preserved. Styling lives in src/styles/landing.css and
 * extends (does not replace) the design tokens in globals.css.
 *
 * Structural differences vs. the static HTML:
 *   - Uses React useState for modal + FAQ accordion instead of inline JS.
 *   - IntersectionObserver .reveal animation ported to a useEffect hook.
 *   - "Book Strategy Call" form POSTs to /api/leads/strategy-call if wired up;
 *     otherwise falls back to the visual "application received" confirmation
 *     identical to the original.
 *   - Logo served from /public/rescia-logo.png (decoded from the original
 *     inline base64 data URI) so the HTML stays lean.

    ['Who is this program designed for?',
     'Multifamily Mastery is built for sophisticated investors, active syndicators, aspiring operators, and high-net-worth individuals serious about building wealth through multifamily real estate. Prerequisites include basic accounting knowledge, familiarity with real estate fundamentals, and at least $100K in investment capital or access to capital sources. The curriculum assumes comfort with Excel modeling and financial analysis.'],
    ['How long does the program take?',
     'The program is structured as 12 modules, recommended at one module per week over 12 weeks. Each module requires 4–5 hours of focused study — reading core concepts, reviewing formulas, working through deep dives, and completing action items using the included templates. Most participants complete the program in 3 months, though you have lifetime access to the materials.'],
    ["What if I've never done a multifamily deal before?",
     'The program is designed to take you from "zero deals closed" to "ready to close your first deal" — assuming you meet the prerequisites. You don\'t need prior multifamily experience, but you should have a foundational understanding of real estate (SFR experience is ideal) and be financially prepared to invest or raise capital.'],
    ["What's included in the strategy call?",
     'Your free 30-minute strategy call covers three things: your current investment position and goals, your specific obstacles to acquiring your first (or next) multifamily asset, and whether the Multifamily Mastery program is the right fit. No sales pressure — the program is selective, and we only move forward if both sides see a clear fit.'],
    ['How is this different from other multifamily courses?',
     'Three key differences. First, it\'s mentorship — not just recorded content. You get direct access to an active operator, not a faceless course library. Second, it\'s comprehensive and sequential — every module builds on the last, following the actual multifamily investment cycle. Third, it comes with the Excel templates and legal documents that are genuinely institutional-grade — the same tools used on live deals.'],
    ["What's the investment for the program?",
     'Tuition is discussed on your free strategy call — it varies based on the tier and whether you\'re enrolling solo or with a partner. The program is designed to pay for itself on your first deal. We only invite candidates in when we\'re confident of that outcome, which is why applications are reviewed individually.'],

                The underwriting module alone was worth the entire program. I&rsquo;d been &ldquo;about to buy&rdquo; multifamily for three years.
                Ten months into the mentorship, I closed my first 32-unit and raised $1.4M from my own network.

                I came in with 14 SFRs and no idea how to scale. The MSA framework and property scorecard alone changed how I evaluate every deal.
                The capital-raising module got me the confidence to actually ask for money.

                real-time answers, and introductions to lenders I couldn&rsquo;t have reached on my own.
